# LSTM Multivariate Crypto Price Forecasting

### Description
This project implements **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks to forecast cryptocurrency prices using multivariate data. The model focuses on predicting the closing prices of **Bitcoin (BTC)**, **Ethereum (ETH)** and **Ripple (XRP)** using historical data fetched from Yahoo Finance. Also project evaluates model predictions using metrics such as **MAE**, **RMSE**, **MAPE** and **SMAPE** to assess the performance of the model.

### Features
- Multivariate LSTM for time-series forecasting
- Daily price forecasting for BTC, ETH and XRP
- Metrics file for MAE, RMSE, MAPE and SMAPE scores
  
### Libraries Used
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

### Data Source
- Data from Yahoo Finance including daily closing prices
- Preprocessing includes normalization and scaling
